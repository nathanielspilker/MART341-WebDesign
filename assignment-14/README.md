My user testings went quite well. I received lots of feedback and was able to gather a lot of data based on my wireframe. I changed a lot of things such as making the website a bit simpler, making some things easier to access such as the contact us being its own page. I wont lie, this was very tough for me. I don't know why, but this assignment was very challenging to me. I'm frankly ashamed of this and need to figure out what went wrong. I wanted to have the header and the logo more detailed. While everything I want for my website is essentially there, is is too plane and boring. Im not proud of my work.
