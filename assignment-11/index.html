      Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is the sequal film in the Star Wars Series. It was written and directed by George Lucas and relased in theatres in 1980. The film features returning characters from the first film such as Luke Skywalker, Lei Organa, Han Solo, C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, and Darth Vader. The film is very importnat to me because it was one of the first films I bonded over with my father.
      It also is just a really good film in my opinion and still holds up very well. One of the main reasons I love this film is becasue in the end, the heroes dont really win. As the name of the film suggests, this film is the revenge of the empire from the first film. It is a retaliation and by the end of the film, the heroes are downtrodden and have lost many of the fights and sturggles througbout the film.
      Overall, I just really love this film and figured I would share my opinion through this website.
